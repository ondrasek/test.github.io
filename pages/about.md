I am passionately in love with .NET and have been working in .NET for about 8 years. 
I also have experience with SharePoint for about 3 years- which includes both SharePoint 2010 and 2013.
I am fluent with html, css, javascript. I have working experience with Java and PHP too. 
If you would like to know more about my technical expertise, my 
[LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/zpbappi) or 
[StackOverflow](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/zpbappi)
profile is a better place. You may also want to check out my
[github](https://github.com/zpbappi) activity.

I am also certified as a [Professional Scrum Master](https://www.scrum.org/User-Profile/userId/155925).

I am always learning something. In March 2016, I have completed the Machine Learning course by 
Stanford University on Coursera. I was extremely impressed and inspired by Andrew Ng's lectures (and, of course,
by my performance). I am sure that I will be looking to switch my career 
into machine learning in near future. I was so happy after completing the course that I paid for the 
[certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/5FDMPMMW47RL) 
to showcase it everywhere. 

Currently, I am working as a Senior Developer @ Readify in Sydney, Australia. 
My recent passion is tdd, f#, microservices, nodejs and python (yeah, all of them). 
As a person, I am fun loving and like to take on challenges. 
I also love to play cricket and table tennis. I like movies for leisure times. 
Travelling at least once a year has become a habit. I <del>am</del> was learning photography. That almost sums me up.

I will get back to you as soon as I can.
