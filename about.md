I am passionately in love with .NET and have been working in .NET for about 8 years. 
I also have experience with SharePoint for about 3 years- which includes both SharePoint 2010 and 2013.
My SharePoint expertise covers- administration, customization, business process development and branding. 
I am fluent with html, css, javascript. I have working experience with Java and PHP too. 
If you would like to know more about my technical expertise, my 
[LinkedIn](http://bd.linkedin.com/in/zpbappi) or 
[StackOverflow](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/zpbappi)
profile is a better place. You may also want to check out my
[github](https://github.com/zpbappi) activity.

As a person, I am fun loving and like to take on challenges. 
I also love to play cricket and table tennis. I like movies for leisure times. 
Travelling at least once a year has become a habit. I am learning photography. That almost sums me up.

Trust me, it works both ways. I will get back to you as soon as I can.
